        <p>n the article “10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills”, writer Michael Gonchar explains the different ways one can use visual thinking when looking at images. He says to look closely, ask questions, notice details, build on other people’s observations, learn more about the world, create conversation, and make new ideas. By using these guidelines, one can notice more details when reading or viewing an image. Katrine Pil’s website, in particular, is a great example of increasing one’s attention and therefore allowing for more visual thinking. The use of many videos, typefaces, bold and italicized text, and unique placement of text grabs the attention of the user. The scrolling action is interactive in itself, as the page, text, and background changes based on user interaction. These movements and changes are eye-catching and can help increase visual thinking. </p>

        <p>In the article “Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows,” Naema Baskanderi talks about the proper design of modal windows, which are pop-up elements that show up on a screen to grab attention, collect input, or provide extra information. While they were originally created to solve specific problems, modals have often become frustrating for users in modern UI design. To create a good modal that doesn’t interfere with the user experience, there are a few key guidelines to follow: it should have an escape option, a clear title, easy-to-understand button labels, should take up about 50% of the screen without needing to scroll, and should be initiated by the user. Modals should also not be used on mobile devices and must be accessible via keyboard and ARIA standards. I think these design recommendations are crucial for making sure modals are user-friendly and don’t disrupt the overall experience.</p>

        <p>In the article “Best Practices for Form Design”, writer Salim Ansari writes about the different elements that make an application's UX easily usable in forms. Some main points he made were that it is important to include only necessary input fields, it is best to use one-column layouts, ask hard questions at the end, and show the user how many steps there are left. Ansari also suggests marking which fields are optional, using field focus, labeling to the top or left close to the input field, using placeholder text as examples, and sizing input fields consistently. Such advice is very important to take into account when designing forms, so they can be easily used and completed. When I think about the forms I have personally filled out, I do agree that such UX techniques made the task more enjoyable to complete.</p>
        <p>Rocket Mortgage's rates form is a great example of a well-made form. It includes one-column layouts, completion status, field focus, detailed error messages, is Tab-Ready, and asks the easiest questions first. It is a great example to reference when looking for a well-made form of UX. </p>
